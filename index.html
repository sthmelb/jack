                        "Jack" is a memecoin inspired by the West Highland White Terrier (Westie), aiming to bring fun and community engagement through its playful tokenomics. Investors participate in a bonding curve model, determining Jack's initial price based on supply and demand. As the community grows, a portion of generated liquidity is allocated to enhance trading on decentralized exchanges, with subsequent token burns to reduce supply over time, potentially increasing value.
